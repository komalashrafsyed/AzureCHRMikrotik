# AzureCHRMikrotik
Instead of a CISCO based router, this walk-through is for those using a mikrotik router and how they can leverage a Cloud Hosted VM created in Azure for their mikrotik network. This walkthorugh comes in 3 parts for easy access and implementation. All supporting files are uploaded under the repo, along with a document walkthrough of each step. Happy Implementation - Cheers :)
